## Introduction

This is an app using tensorflow as the backend (python) the model training can be found in model_data (not used in the app)

## How It Works

The Python/Flask server is mapped into to Next.js app under `/api/`.

This is implemented using [`next.config.js` rewrites](https://github.com/vercel/examples/blob/main/python/nextjs-flask/next.config.js) to map any request to `/api/:path*` to the Flask API, which is hosted in the `/api` folder.

On localhost, the rewrite will be made to the `127.0.0.1:5328` port, which is where the Flask server is running.

In production, the Flask server is hosted as [Python serverless functions](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/functions/serverless-functions/runtimes/python) on Vercel.

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn
# or
pnpm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

The Flask server will be running on [http://127.0.0.1:5328](http://127.0.0.1:5328) – feel free to change the port in `package.json` (you'll also need to update it in `next.config.js`).
